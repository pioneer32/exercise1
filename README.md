# A solution to a programming exercise in Java

* A function/class should merge two arrays of sorted integers.<br/>*For example, given two arrays as arguments: [1,1,3,5] and [1,2,3,4], the result should be: [1,1,1,2,3,3,4,5]*
* The output should be a sorted array containing all the elements from both input arrays, including any duplicates.
* The result should be covered with tests
